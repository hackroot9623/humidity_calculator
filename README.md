This is a simple GUI application built with PyQt5 that functions as a psicrometer calculator. A psicrometer is a device used to measure relative humidity and calculate other psychrometric properties.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install PyQt5
  ```

## Usage

To run the application, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:
  ```bash
  python main_psicrom.py
  ```

The psicrometer calculator window will appear, where you can enter the required values and perform the calculations.

## Functionality

The psicrometer calculator provides two main functions:

1. **Humidity Calculation**: Enter the dry bulb temperature and dew point temperature, and the application will calculate the relative humidity.

2. **S.Term Calculation**: Enter the normal temperature and wind speed, and the application will calculate the apparent temperature (thermal sensation).
